# Project Roadmap

## Mint & Phase 1: The Awakening

Mint Lost SamuRise with land assigned to a Province.

* Mint
  * L1
  * 5,000 free
  * 5,000 paid
  * 600 reserved for the Lost SamuRise team
* **Implement Staking functionality**  
  Stake them on L1 and experience the Lost SamuRise metaverse on L2
* **Implement Quests functionality**  
  Introduce user experience and contracts for quest completion and receiving a reward. Users receives a sword and land NFT, as well as NFTs for any roles they achieved during our pre-launch marketing process.
* **Implement the “PFP Configurator” functionality**  
  Allows a Samurai holder to alter the appearance of their PFP by equipping different items to it

## Phase 2: Faction Building

Introduce Faction mechanics and provide a platform for them to self-organize

* **Implement governance features**  
  Introduce an electoral process both for faction governance and also tactician (which in our case equates partially to treasury management) governance.
  * Tacticians steward the approval of “partner collections”
  * Implement a simple generic for sub-DAO
  * Introduce the concept of competition between the Samurai
    * Samurai’s metadata is updated with faction
    * Staking your Samurai for a locked duration is considered staking with your faction
      * Staking with your faction gives you boost commensurate with time
      * Winning faction gains a better emission rate for the next season

## Phase 3: The Purification

All Factions race towards the endgame to complete the purification of their lands

* Implement worker tokens
  * Worker tokens are utility tokens and gamefi primitives, allowing abstraction of a “board game” type mechanic
  * Worker tokens are only mintable by approved “partner collections”
  * Worker tokens can be placed by their owners on “purified” land
  * Worker tokens have a chance to produce tokens necessary for other game mechanics (crafting, consumables, etc) creating economic sinks
  * Worker tokens require ETH to mint, which gets converted to a market buy of $MAGIC and put into the Lost SamuRise treasury for deployment
* Introduce the Faction Order mechanics to complete the Seasonal Game Loop
  * Complete the Winter game season, and increase competitive advantage by Introducing various Emperor given awards for out-competing enemy factions
