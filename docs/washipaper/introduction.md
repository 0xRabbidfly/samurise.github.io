# Introduction

The Lost SamuRise is a faction based strategy game played in the fictional world of Tengoku (heaven) that has borrowed lore and stylistic elements from Samurai culture in classical Japan. Our GameFi protocol is designed to be interoperable across the entire Ethereum-L2 ecosystem, but we have chosen to enter Arbitrum and join Treasureâ€™s emerging metaverse as part of our initial phase of delivery.

SamuRise builds upon the existing P2E concepts by innovating further into the design elements of timelocked staking to incentivize long-term commitment, inter-factional board game like mechanics to amplify social coordination, risk based decision trade-offs applied to asset scarcity, and providing utility to abandoned NFT collections looking for a lifeline.
