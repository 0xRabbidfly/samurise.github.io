## Vision Statement

We want to build a generic framework for onboarding L1 communities to L2 on-chain experiences. We are targeting Arbitrum, and specifically to expose them to the Treasure ecosystem. This generic framework is be wrapped in the flavor of a Samurai themed metaverse and blockchain game. This unlocks the ability to provide a hands-off onramp for any NFT collection on L1 onto L2. Functioning as an interopability layer, our bespoke integrations between various L1 and Treasure assets will create diverse economic attractors for the Treasure ecosystem.
